# TAKE-HOME-CHALLANGE
In this take-home challenge, I'll build a Natural Language Query Agent over some sample data. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with data, research techniques commonly used to solve such tasks and implement a trimmed down version of the approach to answer simple natural language queries.
